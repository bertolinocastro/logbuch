# Logbuch

A less-do-more program to take your notes quickly before you forget them.

It also compiles in LaTeX for your LabBook/research history. :-)

## Description

Logbuch is a command line tool aimed to quickly take notes while you're closer to a terminal.

Logbuch works handling _Markdown_ files. Each of these files is treated as a _Subject_ and is where the notes are taken. Logbuch groups many _Subjects_ inside its _Project_, as defined by the user.

Each _Subject_ content is converted from _Markdown_ to _LaTeX_ syntax and then becomes a _subsection_ inside its _Project_ _section_. It can also handle figures from one's work/analysis.

## Motivation

As I am pursuing the scientific career, I have noticed that small, but no less important, information are lost quickly while doing day-by-day tasks. Such information can be the separation point between doing unnecessary rework and starting a new day at the next step.

So, I saw that writing concise information, that one can remember without struggling the mind to know what that is supposed to mean, is a huge time improvement. For instance: remote meetings tasks, deliberations and agreements; internet how-to's; papers sentences that one used as reference for one's work or procedures; detailed notes of one's work issues and methodology; thoughts and impressions that one consider important to remember later on; etc.

Besides, I felt that writing them as fast as one can just open one's text editor at any working directory is the point to not forget them.
