# Logbuch

A less-do-more program to take your notes quickly before you forget them.

It also compiles in LaTeX for your LabBook/research history. :-)

## Description

Logbuch is a command line tool aimed to quickly take notes while you're closer to a terminal.

Logbuch works handling _Markdown_ files. Each of these files are treated as a _Subject_ and are where the notes are taken. Logbuch groups many _Subjects_ inside its _Project_, as defined by the user.

Each _Subject_ content is converted from _Markdown_ to _LaTeX_ syntax and then becomes a _subsection_ inside its _Project_ _section_. It can also handle figures from your work/analysis.

## Motivation

As I am pursuing the scientific career, I have noticed that small, but no less important, information are lost quickly while doing day-by-day tasks. Such information can be the separation point between you do unnecessary rework and start a new day at the next step.

So, I saw that writing concise information, that one can remember without struggling the mind to know what that is supposed to mean, is a huge time improvement. For instance: remote meetings tasks and deliberations; internet how-to's; papers sentences that you used as reference for your work or procedures; detailed notes of your work issues and methodology; thoughts and impressions that you consider important to remeber later on; etc.

Besides, I felt that writing them as fast as one can open one's text editor at any working directory is the point to not forget them.
