# Logbuch

A less-do-more program to take your notes quickly before you forget them.

It also compiles in LaTeX for your LabBook/research history. :-)

## Description

Logbuch is a command line tool aimed to quickly take notes while you're closer to a terminal.

Logbuch works handling `Markdown` files. Each of these files are treated as a `Subject` and are where the notes are taken. Logbuch groups many `Subjects` inside its `Project`, as defined by the user.

Each `Subject` content is converted from `Markdown` to `LaTeX` syntax (~~not yet implemented~~) and then becomes a `subsection` inside its `Project` `section`. It can also handle figures from your work/analysis.
